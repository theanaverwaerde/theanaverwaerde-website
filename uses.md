# Uses

I'm still a geek, I want to have a lot of things

## 📱 Phone

I am always being with iPhone and I think I never changed now I'm with the iPhone 12 Pro Max because I watch a lot of anime on so I need a big screen, but my charging port is dead so I bought a Rhinoshield Case Magsafe compatible and a Magsafe cable and it's awesome I can grab my phone with my hand without has a cable bothered me

## ⌨ Keyboard & Mouse

Okay, now we're getting into the special stuff. For my keyboard, I have an ergonomic keyboard, ZSA Moonlander with a custom configuration (If you want to check it's [here](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/LqRnX/latest/0), it's based of AZERTY French layout)
The start is very difficult, so day after day, layout after layout configuration, I'm a used to it and I can really feel the difference about ergonomic and my typing speed (even without a layout adapted for)

And for my mouse it is ergonomic too it's the Logitech MX Vertical, before i having the first price Amazon ergonomic mouse to try and after 2 years I decided to get more quality stuff so I buy it

## 🕹️ Game Controller

I mainly play with Xbox Controller Stellar Shift or Deep Pink, according to my mood. When I play fighting games like SF6 or GGS, I use the Nacon Daija Arcade Stick Xbox, but I think I'll be buying Playstation edition soon, because tournament is ofter held on PS4/PS5. The only exception is when I play on Nintendo Switch I use Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, basic, no color (for now i want to mod it).

## 💻 Laptop

I have recently bought a MacBoook Air M3 16 Go, it's perfect for coding, watch videos or all daily's stuff. And with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate I can play with Cloud Gaming but I really want more games on MacOS #GamingOnMacOS!
