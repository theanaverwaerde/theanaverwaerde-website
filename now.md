# Now

Here you'll find out what I'm doing currently, not only in my tech brain, but also in my life.
I made a lot of things in parallel and I try to work them all at the same time so that I never get bored with a project.

Last updated: **{{ update }}**.

## Currently

- 📍 I live in France near Lille with my parrot "Joséphine".
- 💼 I work at [OverSOC](https://www.oversoc.com), a Cybersecurity Startup in an awesome team.
- 🧠 I'm learning [Go](https://go.dev) with its fabulous mascot.
- 🎬 I'm always watching a lot of anime, my favorite this season is ["Oshi no Ko" 2nd Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/55791/Oshi_no_Ko_2nd_Season).
- 📖 I'm reading ["Sun-Ken Rock"](https://myanimelist.net/manga/8848/Sun-Ken_Rock), it's a manga shōnen written and illustrated by Boichi.
- 🕹️ I'm playing [Core Keeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/) with a group of friends.

## Making

- 🖥️ I'm working on this website (more information on [this](/this) page).
