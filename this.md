<!-- On this page I put what I use to make this website -->

# This

A special thanks to [Alex Hyett](https://www.alexhyett.com), because the structure of this website is inspired by his website.
I was blocked and went round in circles, but then I became a fan of what he had achieved.

If you want to know how I built this website you can check [code source](https://github.com/theanaverwaerde/theanaverwaerde-website).

## Hosting and CI/CD

This website is hosted on **Github Pages** using [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com). It includes a basic CI/CD, which can be found on the workflow list: **GitHub Pages Jekyll By GitHub Actions**.

## Development Environment

For the development of this website, I’m using [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the Light Modern theme (Yes, I’m on the light theme gang).

## Languages Used

The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a touch of **JavaScript**. Some parts of the HTML also incorporate [**Liquid**](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) syntax for dynamic content generation.
I’ve also incorporated some [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org) plugins in the development process.

## Designing

Being a lover of Open Source, I use [**Penpot**](https://penpot.app) on Saas for designing. However, I might switch to self-hosting soon.
